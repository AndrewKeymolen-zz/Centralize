                        </h2>
                        <p>
                          I was hired by Spuerkeess, a private and public bank,
                          as an IT consultant to join the ± 24-person team in
                          charge of the various retail-related software. I
                          started working on Siroco, the software used for the
                          onboarding of customers and the handling of their
                          personal information (contact information, job,
                          relationships with other customers, other legally
                          required information, etc.), the creation of products
                          (e.g., various bank accounts, various debit and credit
                          cards, share accounts, life insurances, etc.),
                          everyday money transfer, some customer relationship
                          management, and many other things. After a couple of
                          months of familiarization through production
                          follow-up, development of new features of various
                          sizes and incident management, I was also asked to do
                          similar interventions on Spuerkeess’ dedicated
                          customer relationship management tool, their risk
                          management tool and their money transfer management
                          tool.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          Those tasks became omnipresent and a daily
                          responsibility as I started working on a first higher
                          stake project involving four developers: the upgrade
                          of Spuerkeess’ risk management tool’s front end so it
                          would become compliant with Basel III, a new
                          regulatory framework. That project being a success, it
                          was followed with another one focusing on the
                          onboarding of new customers on site and on the
                          marketing of existing products to existing customers.
                          At the core of that project was a tablet app
                          consisting of a form customers would fill in before
                          being suggested some banking products according to
                          their answers. The project, involving six developers
                          and three main users, was managed with the SCRUM
                          methodology and I took the responsibilities of an
                          unofficial SCRUM Master for the front-end development
                          team. This became my first experience in project
                          management and resulted in the successful deployment
                          of exciting new software and a new customer
                          acquisition method.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          Since February 2020, I’ve been working on an even
                          higher stake project: allowing potential customers to
                          start their onboarding from the bank’s mobile app as
                          well as to be able to create basic products like bank
                          accounts and debit and credit cards following the
                          onboarding. The ongoing development is going well
                          despite the COVID-19 crisis, and we’re aiming to
                          deploy the project to production in September 2020.

                          My internship took place at DJM Digital, a consulting
                          company, where I had to handle the development from
                          scratch to production of an Android app called “
                          <a href="https://www.ethias.be/pgInt.go?pg=ECIF747&q_lg=1">
                            Ethias Prévention
                          </a>
                          .” That app, an order from the insurance company
                          Ethias, was aimed at their field officers.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          The mobile app was all about facilitating the making
                          and centralization of risk reports. An Ethias employee
                          could go on the field and use Ethias Prévention to
                          save his observation through an ergonomic UI -
                          pictures and videos included. The app could then
                          convert the reports to pdf files before saving them,
                          as well as the media files, on Ethias’ servers. The
                          employee could then send the reports to anyone by mail
                          - to the customer for example - or simply review them
                          later from any device.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          The development was a success; the app went to
                          production, was used by Ethias employees and
                          eventually got an award.
