# Centralize

Centralize is my personal website. I'll try to make it as complete as possible. I used an existing HTML theme that I converted to React and heavily modified. Some PHP was involved for the contact form but it's mainly a lot of Javascript that was added

A lot of components are absent from the repo on purpose. Therefore you should pick what you need for reference, this repo isn't a ready to run one

The backend (in PHP, for the contact form) is in api/contact

## Installation

Feel free to use the code, the main work was done in src\components
